## Courses

### Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

Recommended: Yes

This course is great! A bit of a slog at first since I have programming experience. A lot of the early lectures are about data types, functions, expressions, sort of universal patterns in modern programming languages. I can imagine people with python experience will find them even more unremarkable. But the latter half of the course introduces a lot of basic computer science concepts that I had never studied formally, things like recursion, big o notation, things I "knew" about but didn't really understand. So even though I thought the beginnning was a bit of a chore, and the earlier PSETs were initially tedious, a lot of the lectures delving more into theory were some of the best talks I've encountered in my studies thus far. And they need those earlier lectures and PSETs as their foundation. The lecturers are both great and entertaining and presented the material in a clear and approachable way. They both did a good job of balancing some of the necessary minute details without getting bogged down in the weeds when dealing with granular topics.

The reading I thought was uncessary, not that it wasn't a good book. It was well written and concise, so it's not like it was laborious, but it was just a general rehash of the lectures, which I generally felt were easy enough to follow. Topics requiring more explanation or practice were usually found in PSETs.

I think this course fits the overall goal of my independent-studies project well: to plug in some of my computer science gaps. While I can program and I've picked up concepts at work, writing in different languages, working on my own projects, it's invaluable to have those ideas and practices formalized and explained in an academic setting. 

If I were to start this course again, the only thing I would change is to perhaps move through the first half quicker as it was mostly getting acquainted with python and programming workflows. All in all though, I'm confident this course will pay dividends as I pursue more and more difficult topics built directly upon this one. Very happy I took this course.

### Linear Algebra - Linear Equations

Recommended? No

[Linear Algebra: Linear Equations](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-equations-part-1) was an...unhelpful course. I suppose it's not going to be a very helpful review when a lot of the fault lies on me for not better preparing mathematically for Linear Algebra. Nonetheless, the lecturer had a disjointed way of proceeding through topics that made concepts tough to follow. In my mind, this course is probably fine as a review for people who studied linear algebra in a formal context but not as a standalone resource for self-teaching.

### Learning How to Learn

Recommended? Yes

In my opinion, this should be one of the first recommended courses on OSSU. It's definitely a course I wish I would've taken months ago, which is odd because I was hesitant on taking it until I saw another OSSU student recommend it. I thought it would be another collection of altogether unhelpful tips for learning or maintaining focus: turn off your phone, sit up straight. You know, the kinds of stuff you see in the fourth article on a google search that you try for a few minutes before going...."nope, I still don't know what I'm doing."

This course isn't life changing, but it does present a lot of helpful information in a concise and accessible manner. With the exception of the memory palace stuff, nothing felt gimmicky. And even that, I gave some mental leeway after reading Moonwalking With Eisenstein. A lot of concepts presented in this course are ways to influence your entire approach to studying, not things you supplement your current work ethic with. As someone who's had a pretty rigid method of organizing and tackling new study plans, I felt a lot of the concepts applied to my own approach to learning.

For instance, I've been organizing courses by, say, completing a chapter of some textbook every week. I now realize this isn't the best use of my time for a few reasons. First of all, I have to be reductive about the contents of any given chapter. What if one week in some linear algebra book the chapter is "Geometry Review" and the next is "Matrix Transformations". I would be spending equal amounts of time on each, when it should've been maybe two days on geometry and two weeks on matrix transformations. This was one of the conventions that the Professor pointed out to be a common fault in a person's study habits. Product vs. Process. Yup. "Don't focus on the result, focus on the journey." was the tldr, but hearing it presented in an academic context sold me. Most of my studies have been like that, product and output focused, when the best path is just to allot time. Difficult concepts will naturally consume more and lighter topics won't take up as much. Moving forward, (and I've already started this), I'm trying to make my study plans on a daily manner. Instead of, okay I need to finish this chapter on C++ templates by Saturday (which often resulted in me reading and solving all quizzes for a chapter on Saturday morning), I'm making a daily plan to incrementally handle materials I need to work through. Today, for example, "20+ min of C++, 1 CS Crash Course video, 20+ min of Math 1." Learning this way is a lot more continuous, a lot more routine and less cramming all on some arbitrary date I had set for myself.

The other part of this course I benefited from was the section on the fallacy of comprehension, the idea that humans can easily convince themselves they understand a concept. Dr. Barbara Oakley (the professor) explained it, and I realized that I was guilty of it to a pretty harsh degree. Just having that understanding...that we do this in the face of complex or difficult ideas, has helped me in gauging whether or not I'm ready to move onto new material. The course recommends regular recalling (thinking back over a lesson once completed) and regular testing, which I've been trying to implement regularly into my studies. It's alarming how little I actually grasp on topics I thought I understood.

Again, the course doesn't feel revolutionary in its message, but as someone with a long list of topics I'd like to learn, I feel genuinely prepared to tackle all of those concepts. Learning them may still be daunting, but Dr. Barbara Oakley has given me a solid toolkit, a way to plan and develop stronger means to wrestle with increasingly complex subject matter.

This course is a little hard for me to judge/rate because of how my learning path has changed since I started it. I began learncpp in July. It took me six months of consistent (excluding a few breaks because of life changes) work to finish. I had a different job, I lived in a different place, etc, etc, life changes. But beyond all that, I started this course before I found and committed to OSSU, a program I feel has been invaluable in helping me focus my efforts. If I started OSSU today I don't think I would've included learncpp on there. Not because it isn't a great resource. It's an amazing resource...just not really what I need. With that out of the way though, I can say I did benefit a lot from learncpp. It's written clearly and it shed some light (although not much) on concepts I had employed  but never really understood like pointers or the preprocessor. They're simple enough concepts, and I used them everyday at work during my time programming in obj-c, but I never understood why. I developed these habits from copy pasting and occasional insights stack overflow, but I never understood their purpose or reason. I wouldn't say learncpp gave a fundamental basis to these concepts, but it's gotten me started with some ground-level fluency so I can look into ideas and topics on my own.

And of course, learncpp is great for learning c++ as it's name could apply if you read deep enough (who's to say). But as someone who's had to learn a few languages on the fly, it has become easier and easier to communicate basic ideas in a new language once I understand how to get something to compile and run. Should figuring out C++ be any different? Yup. C++ is massive and has features and tricks and concepts I've never encountered before. As a performative and extensive language, C++ offers a lot of tools, but it also exposes its programmer to a lot of core concepts in the field of computer science, things you don't have to be bothered with in other languages, things that, when I read about them or tried them, exposed how little I understood about the complete picture of programming. The quizzes and readings were helpful, but the most valuable thing I got from learncpp was the exposure to complicated topics that I had not idea how to confront. That is one of the main reasons I still can't help but feel my time would've been better spent on a different course of study, maybe even using this time to contribute to open source c++ projects, and using learncpp as a supplement to those efforts.

## Books

### But How Do it Know? - J. Clark Scott

Recommended? Yes

This book was difficult for me. Even after reading it, spending time with (it took me well over a month to finish), I don't feel confident I walked away with a strong grasp on the innards of a computer. Though, I think that's kind of the point. This book isn't supposed to be an exhaustive resource for unpacking CPU circuitry. And despite understanding this qualification before starting, I was consistently reminded how little I understood even the most simple concepts presented. The goal of the book is to show the basic concepts of a computer, what comprises CPU and RAM and their connection. In that brief overview, the book works. I think it was weakest in supplementing the explanations with visuals. I googled and YouTube a lot of the diagrams just to pair them with something a little more digestible. (I personally recommend PBS's Computer Science Crash Course videos related to computer construction). Learning the nitty-gritty of computer hardware was never the goal. While I do think it's necessary to have some inkling of a clue as to what's going on there, most of the hard stuff is abstracted for a programmer like myself. In that regard, there probably isn't a more approachable resource for tackling something like this.
